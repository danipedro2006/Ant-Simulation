## General info
Individually, ants may be stupid, but put enough of them together and they manage to build nests, grow fungus as food, farm other insects, and even weave their own shelters. When ants forage, they randomly wander the forest or jungle floor and lay a trail for nest-mates to lead them to a source of food. Many individual ants may discover different routes to the same food but the shortest path that leads to it will have the strongest concentration of pheromone, a chemical indicator laid down by the ants. It will swiftly become the most popular path because it is the smelliest and easiest for the ants to spot and track.
What they find in the environment is determined by what's done previously by other members of their colony.

Artificial ants   
To apply this neat organisational ability to networks we create artificial ants that can lay and sniff pheromone trails and can learn their way around a network. At periodic intervals, artificial ants were let loose from each node on these networks and told to find a route to a given destination. By simply laying and smelling the strength of the pheromones along each potential path, the ants swiftly generate maps that show the fastest route to any end point.  
When congestion is simulated on the artificial networks, the ants beat all the other popular routing systems in the speed with which they reconfigure the network to avoid the traffic jams.  

Exceptional abilities    
The artificial ants are also good at solving a version of a knotty computational problem known as the Travelling Salesman Problem, which involves finding the shortest route that takes in all destinations on a given map. The ants have turned out to be exceptional at tackling a variant of this problem known the Sequential Ordering Problem (SOP), in which a number of locations have to be visited and goods either have to be dropped off or picked up.  A fuel firm on the Italian-Swiss border is using ant-derived algorithms to work out the best route for its drivers delivering supplies to petrol stations.
